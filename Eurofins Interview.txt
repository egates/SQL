"do not enter confined spaces without direct approval" - what confined spaces are we talking about?


volitile organic compounds VOC

peristatic pumps - suction lift - tube lowered into the well - agitation caused by this could cause degassing and VOC loss - but it still could be a good option - vaccuum created could result in the loss of dissolved gasses and VOCs
	benefits - small tube diameter allows for access 
	decontamination is easer - tube only
	easy to use
	varialble speed
	readily available and inexpensive
	few moving parts
	versatile - can be set up for filtering, ground water collection
